## 1. Envrionment Setup

Create a new environment named pii_detection and install Python. Replace x.x with the Python version you want to use (e.g., 3.8 or 3.9):

```
conda create --name pii_detection python=x.x
```

Activate the environment:

```
conda activate pii_detection
```

Install TensorFlow for Mac within the activated environment:

```
python -m pip install tensorflow #For TensorFlow version 2.13 or later:
python -m pip install tensorflow-metal
```

Install Additional Libraries

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

```

For natural language processing tasks, especially like tokenization and entity recognition, libraries such as spaCy or Hugging Face's transformers could be very beneficial.

```
pip install transformers
```

Environment Replication for Kaggle

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## 2. Data preprocessing

Since your dataset is in JSON format, you can use pandas to easily load it. We'll load both the training and test datasets.

Before moving on to tokenization, it's crucial to understand your data, especially the distribution of PII types.
